# OnlyOne Project - Claude Instructions

## Code Change Policy
**CRITICAL**: Do not make any file modifications (Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) unless explicitly requested by the user. 

### Rules:
1. **Always ask permission** before making code changes
2. **Read and analyze** files freely for understanding
3. **Suggest changes** but don't implement them automatically
4. **Wait for explicit approval** with phrases like:
   - "Should I make these changes?"
   - "Would you like me to implement this?"
   - "Shall I proceed with the modifications?"

### Exceptions:
- User says "fix it", "update it", "change it", or similar direct commands
- User explicitly asks to "edit", "modify", "create", or "write" files
- Emergency fixes when user reports errors and asks for help

## Project Context
This is a real-time multiplayer word-guessing game with Docker containerization. Always prioritize understanding the codebase before suggesting modifications.

## Commit Policy
After every change, make a commit with one or two sentences explaining the changes.
